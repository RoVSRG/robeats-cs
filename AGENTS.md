# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Core source lives under `src/` (client UI in `src/gui`, shared modules in `src/shared`, server scripts in `src/server`, state in `src/state`).
- Archived Roblox instance trees for reference are in `archive_screens/`.
- Assets and songs reside in `assets/` and `songs/`.
- Build outputs land in `dist/` (generated by Rojo).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run build` — Rojo build to `dist/robeats-cs.rbxl`.
- `npm run serve` — Rojo serve for live sync.
- `npm run songs:build` — regenerate song bundle.
- `bash lint.sh` — regenerate sourcemap if needed and run `luau-lsp` analysis.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Luau/Roblox: use tabs/spaces per existing files; follow Roblox idioms (UDim2/Color3 literals, PascalCase for Modules, camelCase for locals).
- React-Luau: use `React.createElement` (no JSX). Prefer the shared DSL in `src/shared/Util/UI.lua` and theme defaults in `src/shared/Contexts/ThemeContext.lua`.
- Avoid flex props; match archive layout with explicit `UIListLayout`, `UIPadding`, `UICorner` children.
- Lint with `luau-lsp`; keep imports used or prefix unused with `_`.

## Testing Guidelines
- No formal test suite is present; rely on `bash lint.sh` for static checks.
- When adding validation, keep tests close to source (mirrored folder) and name clearly (e.g., `ModuleName.spec.lua`).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep commits scoped and descriptive (imperative tone, e.g., “add main menu DSL”).
- Include context in PRs: what changed, why, and how to verify (commands run, screenshots of UI when relevant).
- Reference related issues/links when applicable; attach before/after captures for UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- In Studio, enable Game Settings → Security → “Allow HTTP Requests” to avoid SDK failures.
- Do not commit secrets; check in generated `roblox.d.luau` only via `npm run download-types`.
