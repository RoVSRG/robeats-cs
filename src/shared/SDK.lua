-- Client-side SDK placeholder or shared types
-- Since we moved all logic to ServerScriptService and only Server scripts were using it (checked via search),
-- this file might now be empty or just defining types.
-- The previous search showed only Server scripts requiring it (ScoreSubmission, Queue, PlayerBus).
-- If the client *did* require it, they would have errored on the "ServerScriptService" require I added earlier.
-- Since I didn't see any client-side hits in the search (only server files), it is safe to make this a stub.
